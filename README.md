# Lab 1 - Fundamentals of Web Development

This is my first project for the **Fundamentals of Web Development** course on Coursera. In this lab, I created a basic HTML file using GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and a code editor. The goal was to learn the tools of internet publishing and publish my first webpage using GitHub Pages.

## About Me

This project contains a simple web page with three `<p>` elements that introduce myself and my interests in web development.
